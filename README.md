# TreasureHunt
TreasureHunt is a program assessment assignment. It was given late 6-12-18 in the evening.   

I have fulfilled the requested specifications outside of a question of that specification orienting around multi threading.
Considering the assesment deals with fulfilling the specs and getting it done in a reasonable timeframe, I am sending this prior
to the coming weekend. If multithreading is a spec, i can work on it. 

The Treasure Hunt program takes in a textFile with BufferedReader. From this point it uses the model set up of map and traveler with
the Controller part of ReadFileTravelerController, MakeTravelerController, and MapController. It outputs the direction
of the treasure through the data provided from the file.
